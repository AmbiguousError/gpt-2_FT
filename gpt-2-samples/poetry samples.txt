There's a certain slant of truth found in all these absurd facts.


MY LITTLE MOUSE



    My little maid became so busy
That nothing but my little cottage broke
       Into.




THE HOUSE YOU NOWN WAS THEY'VE GOT A NICKOCK.


    Therick the house he got it by mistake,
    But all the neighbors were quite right.
    This is the clever man who got it by mistake;
    He bought it on the sly, in guilt;
      And put it right down in the cellar till
      He could not afford to do it right.

    He shot it right through,
      The dog ran away and ate it too.

    And at last he found it;
      And as good as the sly house it was
      The house straightway lies.




SAFETY-BIRD WAS A WIFE


    Savy-worm-bird was a wife the old maid had
      In a garden beyond the river
      And all the neighbors were right.
    This is the clever man who got the bird by mistake,
      And bought it in the market for a penny.




THING OLD WAS BETTER THAN O'ER BEFORE
    They'd tell Mr. Butterfield he had to stop

The dice on the table must be flipped
Caveat emptor because we already won
And then she flips them
Tallyhops and make moves that blow her way to the edge
See a gambler flip his money when he's tipsy
She the type you with then the first to jump and pull
She the one that bring the crowd to its knees
See a tweeter turn his position to his new stomp
Now I'm saying she the one but the name she holds
The strong man impersonating a millionaire
Meek with a state in New York in my ear
Mad they can take it to the chin
Big niggas with large hands
And they can pull it big till the nut snap
Until the roof melt and the curtains blue
Now we paddle waves in Miami
But this is real
Big poppa scared of the bigger fish
So I'm going to put my gun on the line
I'm bigger than what you see
I'm bigger than what you get
Less then what you get
What you get I can't accept it
You jealous cause I ain't with ya
Insensitive huh
So I don't appreciate it
The drink got me feeling like soup
When I'm loading up and I'm taking off
It's like filling up a can
The clap of drum majors
That's how we rock these mics
We rock the mics is how we lavishly
Spend the evening getting them just muscles
Grow an arm and just say jack them
I don't need the straight D
I stuck to my own style and sticks to some new dance ideas
Someay get it in so bad I'm gonna quit
If anyone think this isnt right
If this isnt too late Forget my niXgas niXgas gotta go and die
Forget my niXgas niXgas gotta go and die
Forget my niXgas niXgas gotta go and die
Forget my niXgas niXgas gotta go and die

Nickname Medina just got a heart attack
When you first get exposure
You feel it start to set
You respirate
No words made to describe the sensation
So that would explain the fact that I

Keep my door locked to close enough To get to this point

With an empty belly and ample bitches
Smokin bad Urkel Uzi shirts
No matter what they do Uzi land
You talk so much K we need an explanation Hello from the other side
Where we stood
You changed your ways
And I believe in you
This time you've opened up too much I told you so
You never, never, never, never, come near me again It took all I had to move this one place
Hardly any revelation
Was it a game you were played
And were you satisfied or disappointed
With them other fools surround me again And move all your old friends
To another neighborhood if they try to follow
Me, not one person made me happy
Or do I vibration walk past Come on yeah, come on yeah, come on yeah, yeah, yeah, come on, come on! It took all I had to move this one place
Hardly any revelation
Was it a game you were played
And were you satisfied or disappointed
With them other fools surround me again And move all your old friends
To another neighborhood if they try to follow
Me, not one person made me happy
Or do I vibration walk past How low you can go
 stays the same
 generations to go
It was my mission
 to get a hold of you
And get a hold of you, I pretended
That this time I'd grow old like you
And not have to be happy
Or something like that You picked a bad weed
And people would pick on you
And say that I's romantic
The story of my lovin' through thick and thin
You tell your girl not to worry

======================================== SAMPLE 6 ========================================
ain, pitiful when I say
Can make my feet fail
(Let's try some new things, you know)

Girl you've got a nasty one
Sugar coated love
That sugar coated
Love, that sugar coated
Suckered down into
A million little habits
Now you see my circles showing, girl
You just sleep with your close friends
And you think we're at the end of the road
I don't need them to know what we've done

To demostrate my beauty queen face
To tame my despair
To make my nails feel fresh, hey

Bittersweet love at the end of the day
One kiss for the boy and still another night

And now once she paints the circles, she thinks she found them
Catching feelings inside a man
Now she thinks she wants him too, now she wants him too
[x2]
And when I say I love you, she's literally just falling for you

Make no difference, girl, darling, now, with this double-edged sword
You're gonna be my happiness for the rest of my life
But you're gonna have to do a lot of harm
'Cause you don't need me to believe in your love,
You don't need me to live your life
And you don't need me to do all this negative,
[x2]
Oh girl, my sister needs my loving
Baby, that's all that's on my mind
You don't need me, you don't need me
There's so many things I want and you don't need me
And I'm stuck in the moment, so negative, s'pose I just need time
And that's what you had, eh, eh
When I say that time is, er - is, it really necessary?
Least you would take our chance in the fall

(Just for you)

Mess around, girl, still don't answer the bottle girl,
You seem to want me for nothing
I don't want you.

Mess around, girl, still don't answer the bottle girl,
You seem to want me for nothing
I don't want you, you don't need me,
I don't want nobody.

Mess around, girl, still don't answer the bottle girl,
You seem to want me for nothing
I don't want you, you don't need me,
I don't want nobody.


Three years ago my life changed
An awful lot!
Could have never caught the girl
Seeing full well she just turned her back
I went shopping round town found this littleetsy store
It was in a smiddovitch stitch
Once in awhile thegirls would step
But not always with such a fine bouquet
And lots of time, and some finesse to be found

I went through all of this
Had a real surprise
Beauty said would trade it all
Can't have me like that
And if you want
I'll be in it for as long as I can be
And if you want
It is as real as love it's everyday
So if you want it don't leave it till I'm gone

What a fuckin' spree!
Would have been no problem if they just
Did a little more
Then stopped sending me gifts and behav'
Putting up the cash I knew

Beauty said I'm ugly
I keep thinking that
C'mon baby don't waste your time,
talk more flavor than a Barbie
I'm a criminal whererespect is due
Got theJudgeGOV couldnt giveDawnNoDope no explanation
Just put ya lips in the cookie and eat Split pure nothing
You couldnt buy this
Pork stanky ole' white lace my wife and kids

Beauty said I'm ugly
I keep thinking that
C'mon baby don't waste your time,
talk more flavor than a Barbie
I'm a criminal whererespect is due
Got theJudgePork sitting ole' white lace my wife and kids

I still don't understand
Then my girlfriend gave me a Benzette
Promised she'd have it for me 'til September
But she never showed up and got the letter
So I kept looking back and forth
I was doin' everything exactly the same
Felt like I was the only one
Then she found out I was in charge
So pissed and she kicked my ass
Peeved at my attitude and tried to affect my change
Then she threw a tantrum, threw a tantrum
I don't know what I'm doin'
Please don't punish me

Yeah, you don't want [?]
(You don't want what?] do what
(Why don't you give me what?]
What?

(Why don't you give me what? What?]
======================================== SAMPLE 7 ========================================
I am the vessel for your every motion
When all others are lost in vain
I am the vessel for your every motion
Living with you in a cage
With a key to your life
You slipped and you slid into my body of water
For the centuries I have been locked inside this bubble
This strange water
The only ghost that sees this light
My solutions can be violent
But I bemorrow I'll be out of sight
You understand the picture that you drew?
This ocean lies in wait
Within my blacked-out cafe
It's empty of the sycophants
And pusillanimals in foreign 'em wars
I have little faith but Bloody Sunday
'Cause it's like God unto me
Giving up the fight
But I've got another God
Give me this little more than I can withstand
The lies they telling
Promise to feel me in they bones
But I've learnt just how to retreat when there's a face to face
With no face to face
With no face to face
You understand the picture I've just made If I went all night and I stood on the window ledge
I'd risk a night to come right out and see God
He'd invite me back to his fold
If I stayed up tired of the endless noon
Then I can start again
And I can run till dawn
When I'll come to grips with the fact
We will never part
For a promised better day than dawn
If I go all night and I fell asleep in the web
Behind no-one's future, I dream of diD
And I can't look at it from the other side
'Cause it's just me God, this window ledge's like the past
Loose on my eyes as they loom
Like a vision that's never going to close
Loose on my heart, it's like a nightmare
Until I wake up from this cage
It's like to be held tight
Like a rope that's never going to pull
And this window ledge
It's like the bottom, it's never going to slide
'Cause I'm losin' God
Though I'm feelin' it right now
No-one's ever done more to make us stronger
In this whole wide world so y'all seem to miss me now
Though I'm knowin' where I'll be on this night
Nobody's going on tonight
So don't let them seem a part of the game
Kings never seem to seem like they're holdin' onto for fear of repercussion
Lets play chess before I blow all in my Benjamins
If chess won't kill me yet
It's ahh, hoo, hoo, hoo
Like I said before hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo
It's ahh, hoo, hoo, hoo If I go all night and I drank all of the warm-up
I'm going to have to show myself
Before the judges know it I had to take the toast
It's about time that I had a go
'Cause it's Angels day that I've been puttin' on
It's Angels day that I've been puttin' on
It's Angels day that I've been puttin' on It's Angels day that I've been puttin' on
It's Angels day that I've been puttin' on
It's Angels day that I've been puttin' on Yesterday was the time for us to head down to the river
Two engines had to haul us miles an hour
Three barges had callin' after dark
We headed down the hill to spring-crossin'
But darling never saw the light an make
Liver has an edge for me
Mouthwateriddin' watch me make my first grandfifth
Fiddle and blind us both then you watch out
Jazz Louie's doin' the Jay
How long you think it'll last
Grandfather Jim and Women do lend a hand
But they never will
I used to tell you that it's in your best interest
Not to mention, your boy's got a taste for Viagra an' petals on his elephant
You're just lookin' at large swaths of shit so it's not that surprising
But you can't serve every hungry brat]
So come here small as this
See I'm just playin' small changes
Take a first of its place
Then take a second
Immerse yourself in what this is all about
You don't have to be a no man an' ask me how this feel [in flight]
This feels like a thousand miles
It feels like the weight is now on my mind
I'm movin' onto my next mans [In flight] I'm goin' up to these the rare VIP's
Harder, they can't go harder
Look harder, look harder

Ten to twenty million dollar bills
Got a lot of fame
Money tell is bullshit

He got a lot on his mind and love to get it out though
And I handcuff my shit then he say fuck it
I'm dangerous as a cobra jumping Jets come out trunks
There's supposed to be some kind of freedom for me out here
Had to hop in his Aitz-Back
'Cause I was born in Hell's been warm before
Shelling my old man a couple thousand dollars
Might let her have a baby lookin' the other cheek
I'm dangerous as a cobra, flying Bibnob
Checking out her new findin'

No need for look-as and re-as-es
The black & white man get bucked once again

A little jam for a fuckin' fool
Cuttin' up some Prince old school to play some piano
Why stop when the world is aw!) Go toensheep andhey motherfucker
Take a bow back through your ghetto town
Hop up out the castle just chillin' and whiskey a little
Liquor millin' as we take our first run at shaking
Gotta gotta castles with a rolling castle

Speedin ridin' up the Polaroids is a saint

======================================== SAMPLE 9 ========================================
How can a dream be so real
When you didn't know what you were missing They took my chain, raped me
Baby, you own me, like a puppet
They locked me in the game you sell me
Watch me starve to death
Your love has bought me hearts like yours
I'm sick of useless and useless
I'd be useless as a cookie
Tied you to the stickest piece of meat Ever since I left my job atlas
Got rich, never had a lot
Funny, how am I supposed to be feeling
When I'm sitting here with my bank director
And her partner is at work in the kitchen?
When I pour them out I never hit the bartender?
And the maid in the paddy paddling with the key chain Ever since I left my job atlas
Got rich, never had a lot
Funny, how am I supposed to be feeling
When I'm sitting alongside my provincial champion
And the man in the white dress riding in the seat Can I have some chl-l-l himself
Can I have some blank seats
Can I have some blank seats
Can I have some drunken people
Can I have some blank seats
Can I have some drunken people Can I have some blank seats
Can I have some key actors
Can I have some rich people
Can I have some dozen stories
Of boring provincial rhyme and grammar Ever since I left my job atlas
Got rich, never had a lot
Funny, how am I supposed to be feeling
When I'm sitting here with my bank director
And my twin girlfriends inted
While Alberta's rocking away
We can laugh and melt like glaciers
But I'll have to lay claim to your Jubilation
In doing so, title belt
Though to love my landlord I'll be blessed
And grant the rent increases As you see, I bought this brand new homo My name is Victor Morris
And I was grooming this brand new schlong
While he was spendin' time
Checkin' out his autopsy report Audemar traveled the world
Quadruple between enlightened and envious
As in he wore a red bow tie and a red dress
While he murdered rhymes so concise
There's one he can't pronounce but there's a supercut blade
That he can stab and he can kiss
But he won't kill, so who's gonna do the stab He's an actor in and around New York
Twelve years old and counting, sources tell me the time
Has come for him to tap
 into the teenage angst
As teenagers are educated to handle tricky shit
Well here's my proposition to those semi haters
Fuck y'all post mortem cuz in God's name
We gon' turn the tables on the Manx like this
Like dentifogs, Lutherans, and Quakers
Because fuck y'all forever y'allucks
Like dentifogs, cats out fattin' muscle Cmere times in a row, man, they don't make me
Have to call my germs based on my hair
Now my x's wake 'em up times, my geniuses
Don't put me on the team, they smell me out
I scribble shit like I'm Lebron and you can see the stash
Go bigger the harder you try These rappers should be puttin' up y'all try mo's
These rappers should be puttin' up y'all wack words
Make ya senile
Um hm? Asians?
These niggas couldn't tell us nothing would work
Tried to stab it like bad DNA
Niggas like linkin' like a needle
This ain't permafly, linkin' too fast
How the fuck am I supposed to know when to I'm gone
And if I made sense now I bet ya
You gon get the MAC game now
You gon get the Nikes now, now
You gon' see what I do, now
Now I'm like gunflame, cause I'm like karlin' post
Now I'm like baby, you know that long hair
Lookin' like a college kid that got pretty much lost
Wet your cartridge to the cookie
Now you think you've got the beat and the flow
But it's like an optimist thinkin' that your whole style's changed
You just wanna play the one true
Listen to your body, just relax
You could bench pressed Donatella (I can, girl)
Cam, Kadeisha, they the only ones I lean with
Kadeisha, they my best friend, they everything
I'm dope with cause we 'bout boy genius
Raised over money, raised over money
Let's go platinum, let's go gold
Lil Bozzy, I keep em all locked
I'm in the belly of the beast, I'm in the belly of the

My pockets almost match the brown glitter of the nails
He wants it, and I think he wants the fast stuff
The bowl's old but I think I like the smell of it
He's a stanky funny funny funny 2 leave your killin' hockin' alone

Besides the women who's flossin' on Saturday
I got a whole bunch of new friends who ain't so sick
(New friends what'scha wanna do?)
Some of them I'll admit when she's with me
And some of them I'll go and shake their ass
And that's just fine, because that's what friends are
(We say all the best things, never aside)

Some of them still think they'll ever love U
When in fact they despise what U do
Some still think they'll ever love U
When in fact they despise what U do
In the club they can laugh all night all night
If 6 was their friend it'd be still be alive
If they come in the club they'll be 6'2"

I tell them what I
======================================== SAMPLE 11 ========================================
I try to tell ya, don't forget me
Who givin ya lover four or five movie tickets yesterday
Why, 'cause I 'm always choosin' what you want
And you've been good to me
So why complain when you know what I'm doin'
And you won't tell, you know, no, no
When you have trouble concentrating when tight and on the beat
And when trouble appears to me as a brand new face to see
So why'all complain when in the dark
You have no one to trust
When the devil is my man and I don't see anyone
To stick up your own fools' armor We always on tiptoes to give you a taste
Don't believe everything we say because we doubt your mind
Or maybe your heart
But let me think, this rap game must be honest
I got pockets twenty kWHp and a car,cause of it's age We always on tiptoes to give you a taste
Don't believe everything we say because we doubt your mind
Or maybe your heart
But let me think, this rap game must be honest
I got pockets twenty kWHp and a car,cause of it's age Hey Boy it's your birthday, and you're cool
'Cause we're old school, 'cause we put the heater to your ear
It may not be for all guys but we still wear our high heels
And do our best to have fun when we ride We always on tiptoes because we doubt your mind
Or maybe your heart
But let me think hey boy how 'bout you riding
Do you mind (Do you mind?)
Tell me (Do you mind?)
Is there a special place for you, imaginary people
Not real life, where we go insane
It's the bedroom, the insane asylum Hey boy it's your birthday, and you're cool
'Cause we're old school, 'cause we put the heater to your ear
It may not be for all guys but we still wear our high heels
And do our best to have fun when we ride We always on tiptoes because we doubt your mind
Or maybe your heart
But let me think, this rap game must be honest
I got pockets twenty kWHp and a car,cause of it's age It's your birthday, let's party
Party tonight, rock by tonight
Don't lie to me, tell me you want to gimme that thumb
Because tonight I saw you Now if (if) you and I could get married today
Well, I'd shut you up inside (inside)
Of our little island cafe
(But I won't let me in)
But we'd be lost without you, and that's exactly what today's here
Let's party and have a good time
It's your birthday, let's party
Let's party and have a good time
It's your birthday, let's party
It's your birthday, let's party and have a good time We are small, lonely strangers
Just a couple of people in time and the today's here
Turn your today's to the fullest
In my lifetime, no parallel This world is never ending
See everybody makin' some adjustments
You say it's cool
But we were losers then and we always will be
They orderedsurprise, it was our mistake
They say our lives are upon us
And we would never beme me
And them And last night
I think I heard them say
That we needed a new anthem
My life's in ruins, I don't wanna go again
And I don't know what to do
You just left and said you were with another man
Now I'm wondering
What have I become, what will I do
I took what I gave and I gave it up
And turned around and gave it back What have I become, what will I do?
I took what I gave and I gave it up
And turned around and gave it back What have I become, what will I do?
I took what I gave and I gave it up
And turned around and gave it back What has I become, what will I do?
I took what I gave and I gave it up
And turned around and gave it back What has I become, what will I do?
I took what I gave and I gave it up
And turned around and gave it back What has I become, what will I do?
I took what I gave and I gave it up
And turned around and gave it back Hakuna Matata, see ya later
Let's go when we're up
Where we go without a reason and a reason not a reason
When it's your world, I think it's so magical
You become this, everything I love, everything I have, everything Hakuna Matata, see ya later
Let's go when we're up
Where we go make
